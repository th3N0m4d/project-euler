# Project Euler

After reading a few pages of the classic "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen et al, I felt excited to be able to put the theory into practice. However, I needed exercises to practice in order to hone my skills.

Project Euler is a simple website containing a large catalogue of math challenges geared towards programmers. The first 50 challenges are apparently easy while the others tend to be more challenging.

This repo is an attempt at solving as many problems as I can. As an added criteria, the code has to be as declarative as possible.
